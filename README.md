# Laser Cut

### The main purpose of this project is to create a well structured documentation about how to create new Inkscape extensions. Additionally, some extensions or functions will be designed and implemented in order to facilitate the work of people that use this program to design pieces to be cut by a laser cut machine.
###
### Every created extension will be made freely available to whoever requests it and the extensions will be offered as free software, thus anyone who wishes to modify the code in order to personalize it or tailor it to their specific needs will be able to do it.
